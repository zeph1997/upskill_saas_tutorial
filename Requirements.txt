Stripe Integration
* Users should have a stripe customer token in the users table.
* Javascript should prevent Pro form from subitting, when user fills it out,
and should send card info to stripe. Stripe will return with a card token.
* Javascript should send user fields and card token to our rails app. Rails app 
should validate the user fields. Rails app will note whether plan 1 or plan 2.
* Once validated, Rails should send user info (email, plan id) and card token
to stripe server and stripe will create a subscription and send back customer
token. Rails should save customer token and user information to our database.
